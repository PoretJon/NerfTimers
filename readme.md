# NerfTimers

### What is this?
NerfTimers is a repo I've made to document/share the various timers/gameplay objectives I've created for RIT's Foam Blaster Club. I will share here not only development models, but fully completed, 3D printable enclosures and code for my timers. Each timer will have its own readme including a BOM, any libraries used, and anything else thats needed for that specific timer.

### Hardware/Basic Requirements
For these timers, I created all of the timers to run on raspberry pi picos, as I had a couple laying around from other projects and wanted to use them for something.
These can be found really anywhere, but I bought mine on amazon: https://www.amazon.com/Raspberry-Pi-Pico-RP2040-microcontroller/dp/B09437S9X4/

As of right now, all of the timers are programmed using CircuitPython, and I plan on eventually updating all of these to be written in C so the proper firmware can just be flashed onto the picos for easier updating.
